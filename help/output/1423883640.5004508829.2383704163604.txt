HELP me.  I am stuck on call at St. Joes and feeling lonely and under appreciated.  These women just expect pain relief and don\'t understand the years of training and skill that is required to provide them pain relief.  They just take government money and expect the world.  And when they don\'t want my help I sit all alone in my call room with Modern Family reruns on TV and read old e-mails.  This life----- is it worth it?  What will tomorrow look like?  :)
